## Stocks Analysis
### Overview of analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how stocks are performing in any given year. I was given a set of data to perform the analysis. It was made to work quickly, and at the click of a button. 

### Analysis and Challenges

#### Analysis

Once the data was formatted to something more legible for the average person to read, it was made available to the rest of Steve's team. As we can see from the "All Stock Analysis" sheet, the rate of return in 2017 was much more successful than 2018. Nearly every stock tracked had a positive return in 2017. <insert 2017 here>

In 2018 the rate of return drastically changed. Nearly all stocks tracked showed a negative rate of return. There were two stocks however, that showed positive results both years running. Stock ticker "enph" and "run" showed returns between 81% - 85% in 2018. <insert 2018 here>

#### Challenges

There were many challenges that led to the creation of this formatted sheet. The original VBA code eventually functioned, but it ran at a much slower rate than the refactored version.
